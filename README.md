Dining Philosophers problem, multi-threads programming with the use of mutex 

## Installation and execution
```
cd philo
make
./philo 4 500 200 200 5
```
arguments: ```number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]```
*   ```number_of_philosophers```: The number of philosophers and also the number
of forks.
* ```time_to_die (in milliseconds)```: If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die
milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
* ```time_to_eat``` (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
* ```time_to_sleep``` (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
* ```number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat``` (optional argument): If all
philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.
